Prototype Windows Mobile 6 app for a tech repair business, interacts with RepairShopr.

The idea behind this app is to create a lightweight program that works on Symbol/Motorola MC67/70/75 rugged mobile computers running Windows Mobile 6, 6.1-6.1.4, and 6.5-6.5.3, and interacts as much as possible with RepairShopr to allow tech repair businesses to use an affordable and robust terminal, now easily findable on eBay, etc.

The basics:
  Integrate Tickets, Customers, Assets, Invoices and Inventory. Add barcode lookup.

Next, work on Contracts, Parts, Estimates. Then Wiki, Reports and possibly Calendar (although that could connect with the Calendar app possibly, yet to be seen.)

An end goal would also be to allow payments to be processed via a processor integration and the Chip + Pin snap-on accessory, however this is yet to be seen if it is achievable.
